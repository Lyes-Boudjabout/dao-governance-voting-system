**DAO Governance Voting System** â€“ A decentralized governance framework enabling token-based voting for proposal management, built with Solidity and integrated with OpenZeppelin Governor contracts. This system allows DAO members to create proposals, cast votes (For, Against, Abstain), and execute decisions through a TimelockController for secure, transparent, and community-driven decision-making. Designed for extensibility, on-chain execution, and full compatibility with ERC20 governance tokens, ensuring robust and democratic DAO operations.
